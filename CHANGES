1.06  Sun Feb 21 12:54:22 2010
	- Change namespace from CGI::Application::Demo to
		CGI::Application::Demo::Basic, to force files to be
		installed separately from other modules called
		CGI::Application::Demo::(Ajax, Dispatch).
	- Re-write and/or re-design the docs.
	- Document much more clearly what needs to be patched by the end user.
	- Move CSS and HTML templates into htdocs/assets/..., and
		simplify their names.
	- Move the CGI scripts into cgi-bin/ca.demo.basic, and
		simplify their names.
	- Use DBIx::Admin::CreateTable rather than copying some of its code.
	- Remove text 'All rights reserved' (for Debian licensing).
	- Remove POD heads 'Required Modules' and 'Changes'.
	- Replace personal doc root with /var/www.
	- Use namespace::autoclean with Moose.
	- Change default database driver to SQLite.
	- Change path to Perl to /usr/bin/perl. Thanx for Larry for bug report #45751.
	- Change path to config files and templates to /var/www/.
	- Remove scripts/bu-demo from the distro.
	- Eliminate references to $ENV.
	- Write a new module to handle reading config files.
	- Move the config files into lib/CGI/Application/Demo/Basic/Util, so they
		can be installed with the *.pm files, and so Config::Tiny
		can find them easily. Change config file handing to match.
